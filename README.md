butterfly-whistle-toy
=====================

A toy that makes use of the html5 web audio API to measure the pitch of your whistling and use it to control a butterfly with CSS transform.

Still to do
* replace the pitch detection algorithm with something more reliable, it doesn't work well with my singing for some reason
* replace the animation to make it smoother
